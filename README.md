📦 Project Name (RouteSolver Pro)
A modern and efficient Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) solver built for scalable logistics optimization.
Whether you manage a small fleet or coordinate large-scale delivery operations, RouteSolver Pro provides fast, cost-effective routing solutions.

🚀 Key Features
Flexible input for fleets and customers

Distance and capacity constraints built-in

Modular design: easy to customize for advanced heuristics or metaheuristics

Extensible: plug in new solver strategies without rewriting core components

Visualization tools (optional) to inspect routes

⚙️ Installation
git clone https://github.com/QassimAltarhouni/RouteSolver-Pro.git
cd route-solver-pro
pip install -r requirements.txt
🧠 Usage
python solve_cvrp.py --data path/to/data.json --output output/routes.json
--data: JSON file describing customer locations, demands, and fleet information

--output: Where to save the computed routes
